                        Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive 
                        of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities 
                        of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
                        in which there is no center because every point, or none, 
                        is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. 
                        The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly 
                        round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                        Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used 
                        for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from
                        science. The early warnings about technological dangers
                        also come from science.

                        What was most significant about the lunar voyage was 
                        not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

                        A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, 
                        upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than 
                        her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. 
                        I could not help but love and cherish her.

                        For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds 
                        and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly 
                        changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are 
                        far more valuable than those which divide us

                        Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. 
                        And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill

                        Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of 
                        any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical 
                        process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the 
                        natural laws of human development.

                        As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. 
                        Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can 
                        imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, 
                        so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble 
                        and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
